title = "pursuing independence"
+++

i think my aim is to pursue independence with technology. but looking at all of the technology,
and all of the programmers out there, sometimes i just feel... lost.

a lot of the companies i see out there today aren't actually finding a problem to solve. instead, they're 
creating a solution to a non-existent problem. if you look around at some of the most popular apps, how have
they actually improved anyone's lives? most of them are designed to capture as much of your attention as possible.

of course this is a massive generalization. there are a bunch of great companies out there too.

i think you can achieve a level of financial and personal independence due to technology. independence in general, though, is overrated;
humans can't really live a solitary life.

i think independence from a digital perspective also means being able to build things you think are cool.
i'm not saying every single thing you build needs to be super useful and solve a problem. but independence means
building projects *you* find interesting, not just ones you copy from youtube because you think it will look good on a CV.
things that you actually have a passion to build, and that might be able to give you more financial independence.

anyway, not sure where i was going with this post but wanted to share my thoughts.

hope you enjoyed!
