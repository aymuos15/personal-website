i think my aim is to pursue independence with technology.

a lot of the companies i see out there today aren't actually finding a problem to solve. instead, they're 
creating a solution to a non-existent problem.

those who came before us who built large companies did solve a problem - ebay with marketplaces, google with pagerank - did so,
because they wanted to build something cool and useful to people. they pursued technology through the lens of independence,
and achieved independence for themselves.

you can provide a lot of value by building software compared to other white-collar jobs as port19 pointed out to me, but also,
programming can give you a high level of autonomy.

you have control over your personal time, you can make architectural decisions, and gain an income from it - all whilst building
something cool or useful. this is especially true if you build your own indie apps. you're entirely self-sustainable in those
aspects.

i think independence from a digital perspective means being able to build things you think are cool.
i'm not saying every single thing you build needs to be super useful and solve a problem. but independence means
building projects *you* find interesting, not just ones you copy from youtube because you think it will look good on a CV.
things that you actually have a passion to build, and that might be able to give you more financial independence.

anyway, not sure where i was going with this post but wanted to share my thoughts.

hope you enjoyed!

*thanks to port19 who reminded me this article needed a good rewrite and for the interesting email.*
