i think my aim is to pursue independence with technology.

i'm not against freelancing, or traditional jobs at all. in fact i think they're super important, and they can help 
you build up a strong network and make friends too.

but looking at all of the technology, and all of the programmers out there, sometimes i just feel... lost.

a lot of the companies i see out there today aren't actually finding a problem to solve. instead, they're 
creating a solution to a non-existent problem.

if you look around at some of the most popular apps, how have they actually improved anyone's lives?
most of them are designed to capture as much of your attention as possible, to make the most money and i can't
see myself wanting to code for a company like that.

of course this is a massive generalization. there are a bunch of great companies out there, building things that 
people really need. and even if it's not something people "need", they at least have good intentions and are focused
on building something that people can enjoy, rather than focused solely on money. maybe i'm being naive, though.

on independence, i think digital independence is the goal. independence in general is overrated; humans can't
live a solitary life (generally speaking). but i want to do my best in not relying as much on technology in general, 
or using these apps which have no benefit to everyone and in fact, just make society worse.

i think independence also means being able to build things you think are cool. i'm not saying every single thing you 
build needs to be super useful and solving a problem. but independence means building projects *you* find interesting.

projects that you aren't just copying from youtube, or that you think will look good on a CV. projects that you haven't 
copied from "top 5 startup ideas to make 1 million dollarts!!111!1!!". 

things that you actually have a passion to build, and that might be able to give you more financial independence.

i also have an issue where a lot of the areas of technology i'm interested in don't necessarily align with my values. 
but i think again that comes back to independence. 

if your day job doesn't align necessarily with your values, maybe you can pursue independence through other means in the 
way that you use technology, or if you build other things in your spare time.

anyway, not sure where i was going with this post but wanted to share my thoughts.

hope you enjoyed!
