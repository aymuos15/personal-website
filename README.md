This is a simple and minimal website built with Zola and plain CSS.

## Why Zola?

No particular reason, just wanted to use a SSG (static site generator) and it looked cool and is built in Rust.

## Other Information

- Hosted on Vercel
- Writing section links to blog pages

## Use
Feel free to fork it, use it, host it, or do whatever else with it you want :)
